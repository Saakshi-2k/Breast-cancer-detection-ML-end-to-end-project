Breast Cancer Detection Machine Learning End to End Project

In this I have added extracted features of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells. As a part of Machine learning engineer / Data Scientist has to create an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor and to complete this ML project I am using the supervised machine learning classifier algorithm.

The accuracy of this project is 98.24% and XGBoost Algorithm is the most accurate model over other ML Algorithms.


Sometimes we might face some error in loading the jupyter notebook file named breast cancer detection model using supervised learning algorithms.ipynb and writes "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?".However you can use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and paste the link in it.
